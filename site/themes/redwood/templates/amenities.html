		<p>There is a second fridge and an additional shower in the basement, along with the washer and dryer. The nearest Hospital is in Huntsville which is a 45 minute drive. There are doctors in Burks Falls, by appointment only. Swimming is great off the dock. A well mannered friendly leashed dog is welcome and we support the “poop and scoop” program. A maximum of 2 dogs are allowed. Excessive barking is not permitted. The fire pit is right beside the water and firewood is supplied.</p>
