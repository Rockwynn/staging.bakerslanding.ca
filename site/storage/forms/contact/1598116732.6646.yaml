comment: "Hi Jeff and Kathy,\r\n\r\nI'm interested in renting your cottage next summer August 14th to August 21nd 2021. We are a family of 4, 2 adults and 2 children (Victoria 8 and Kathryn 10). We also have a well behaved, professionally trained, 5 year old poodle. She is sweet natured, calm, intelligent and has a very laid back temperament. We use a paw cleaner each time she enters the house. Let me know if those dates are available and if you would like pictures of the dog.\r\n\r\nElizabeth Machula\r\n416 618 4424"
