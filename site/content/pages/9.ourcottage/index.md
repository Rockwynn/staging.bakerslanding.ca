Come out and enjoy our beautiful Lake Cecebe cottage.

and relaxing home-away-from-home. Enjoy the 40+ miles of boating pleasure on scenic Lake Cecebe and through the
Magnetawan River system; boat through the historic lock system at Magnetawan to the beauty of Ahmic Lake; enjoy
great fishing (small mouth bass, walleye/pickerel, northern pike and yellow perch); swimming, hiking, bird watching,
picnics or just relax to the call of the loons. Golfing, horseback riding, shopping and excellent dining are nearby
or just relax over marshmallows at the fire pit. Just one hour to Huntsville, North Bay or Parry Sound and less than
3 hours from Toronto.
