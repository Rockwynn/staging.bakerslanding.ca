        <h1 class="white-sub-heading"Terms and Conditions</h1>
       <p class="white-text">This is a family-oriented home and not suitable for groups looking to party.  It is comfortable with 6 persons but will hold 8.</p> 
       <p class="white-text">Baker’s Landing house is available for weekly rentals from mid-June through late September. Four (4) night minimum stay rentals are welcome after September 11th. </p>
       <p class="white-text">Full week (7 night) stays are required in June, July, August and up to early September. The rental week begins and ends on Saturday. </p> 
       <p class="white-text">Check-in is no earlier than 2:30pm and check-out is no later than 10:30am.</p>
       <p class="white-text">Potential guests will be asked to fill out and return a rental application form similar to those required by most cottage rental firms. Information on the form will be used for screening purposes and will be kept private and confidential.</p>
       <p class="white-text">A non-refundable deposit of $500 for each week is required to confirm all bookings. The remainder of the rental fee must be paid 30 days before the start of the rental period. If the cottage is booked less than 30 days in advance the entire rental fee is due at the time of booking.</p>
      <p class="white-text">A cheque for $350 as a cleaning/damage deposit is required before your arrival. This deposit will be returned, or the cheque shredded, if Baker’s Landing House is left in the condition it was found.</p>
      <p class="white-text">Guests are expected to bring their own sheets, pillow cases and towels.  ***SHEET PACKAGE: Sheets and house towels are available for $60 for 1 to 4 guests and $90 for 5 to 8 guests, if reserved ahead. Beach towels are not included.***</p>
        <p class="white-text">A well behaved pet(s) is welcome with prior arrangement.  Maximum 2 dogs (no exceptions).  Unfortunately cats are not allowed. </p>
       <p class="white-text">Come and listen to the call of the loons.  Enjoy the sunrise and your morning coffee on our large deck or on the 30’dock.  Catch your “dinner” when fishing off the dock for bass, pickerel or pike.  The fall leaf color is usually very beautiful starting mid September. Baker’s Landing is on Lake Cecebe – only 2 hours north of Barrie!</p>
