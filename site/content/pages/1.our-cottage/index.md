Come out and enjoy our beautiful Lake Cecebe cottage.

Set in the beautiful Almaguin Highlands, this beautiful 2-storey, 3 bedroom home is a very comfortable, peaceful
and relaxing home-away-from-home. Enjoy the 40+ miles of boating pleasure on scenic Lake Cecebe and through the
Magnetawan River system; boat through the historic lock system at Magnetawan to the beauty of Ahmic Lake; enjoy
great fishing (small mouth bass, walleye/pickerel, northern pike and yellow perch); swimming, hiking, bird watching,
picnics or just relax to the call of the loons. Golfing, horseback riding, shopping and excellent dining are nearby
or just relax over marshmallows at the fire pit. Just 45 minutes to Huntsville and an hour to North Bay or Parry Sound.  Less than 3 hours from Toronto.

Set on 2+ acres with 600' of private water frontage, this home includes a master bedroom with en-suite, and sliding doors from the large cathedral ceiling living room to the expansive wrap-around deck. The kitchen and dining room also overlook the lake and the property boasts a drilled well, south east exposure, 48' dock, air conditioning and sleeps a maximum of 8 people. A 40" HD TV (satellite connection) and DVD player/recorder are also included and are part of the full surround system.

Baker's Landing does NOT have its own internet coverage. Bring your own Bell or Rogers stick or hub, or a Smartphone, for internet connections. There is also good Rogers and Bell cell phone reception, so a Smartphone can be used as a hotspot. No modem is provided. The public library in Magnetawan (a 20 minute drive away) provides free high speed internet and your hosts can give you the password. The library has limited hours, but wifi can be accessed from a picnic table outside the library or from your vehicle in the parking area. Or Tim Hortons in Burk's Falls also has free internet coverage.

Both the upper and lower deck and the dock are ideal for sitting in the sun, watching the world go by, a morning cup of coffee or an evening drink. The expansive upper lawn is excellent for badminton, croquet, tetherball (all provided) or other sports. The dock ladder allows easy access to the lake for swimming.


Fishing is excellent and you can catch small mouth bass, walleye/pickerel, northern pike and yellow perch. In the past many years Lake Cecebe has been stocked annually with pickerel fry, by the Almaguin Fishing and Improvement Association.
A 16' fibreglass canoe and a 4-seater paddleboat are loaned to you on your vacation.
Boats and/or motors can be rented on the lake and there are several boat launches if you are bringing your own boat. 
Come and listen to the loons, relax and enjoy all that the lake and the area have to offer!

A well behaved 100% house trained friendly dog that is good with strangers is allowed if the owners agree to "poop and scoop". The dog must be on a leash and cannot be left alone in the house or tied outside to bark at any time. There is a 2 dog maximum limit (no exceptions). Unfortunately cats are not allowed.

This property is ideal for a couple, family or extended family with grandparents and very suitable for active seniors. The house is very comfortable with 6 quests and a bit crowded with 8. Because of the 2 levels, the house does not lend itself to anyone with mobility issues.

Guests are expected to bring their own sheets, pillow cases and towels.
SHEET PACKAGE: Sheets and house towels are available for $60 for 1 to 4 guests and $90 for 5 to 8 guests, if reserved ahead. Beach towels are not included.

Baker's Landing is a 100% NON SMOKING home, both INSIDE AND OUT

The rental period is Saturday to Saturday. Check-in is 2:30pm and check-out is 10:30am. A minimum 4 night stay is offered after September 11th until we close later in the month.

Potential guests will be asked to fill out and return a Rental Application form, similar to those required by most cottage rental firms. Information on the form will be kept private and confidential.

Waterfront: The shoreline is rocky. The 32' dock has a swimming ladder at the end. Swimming off the dock is good. The depth at the end of the dock is approximately 5-6'. Lots of room for boat parking.

Heating: the furnace and air conditioning operate via a heat pump from our well. An automated propane back-up generator is beside the house in case of hydro outages.

Guests are allowed as long as they are not exceeding the 8 guest limit. For day guests, please inquire.

We hope you like our site, and look forward to talking with you. Please contact us with any questions you may have. 

Jeff and Kathy
