    <p>Baker’s Landing is on Lake Cecebe – good swimming, fishing, boating, etc. By car it is only 20 minutes
    to either Magnetawan or Burks Falls. By boat, it is 8 miles down to Magnetawan and 14 miles up to Burks Falls.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>From #11 Highway, take either exit into Burks Falls</li>
        <li>Turn on to Hwy #520/Ryerson Crescent</li>
        <li>Continue along Hwy #520 for 3.9 kms</li>
        <li>Then turn left on Midlothian Road</li>
        <li>Drive along Midlothian Road for 9.1 kms until you reach the first and only 4 way intersection</li>
        <li>There is a barn on your right with a bright red roof at this 4 way intersection</li>
        <li>Turn right, this is  Starratt Road</li>
        <li>Continue along Starratt Road for 4.2 kms (if you go any further you will be in the lake)</li>
        <li>At this point the road turns 90 degrees to the right and the name changes to Sandwood Drive</li>
        <li>Continue for another 13 seconds (approximately 130 meters) and you will be at Baker’s Landing (#19 Sandwood Drive)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Highway #11 is 4-lane driving all the way to Burks Falls, which now boasts a Tim Hortons coffee shop!</p>
