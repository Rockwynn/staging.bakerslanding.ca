Baker’s Landing is on Lake Cecebe – good swimming, fishing, boating, etc. By car it is only 20 minutes to either Magnetawan or Burks Falls. By boat, it is 8 miles down to Magnetawan and 14 miles up to Burks Falls.

From #11 Highway, take either exit into Burks Falls, and then turn on to Hwy #520/Ryerson Crescent. Continue along Hwy #520 for 3.9 kms, then turn left on Midlothian Road. Drive along Midlothian Road for 9.1 kms until you reach the first and only 4 way intersection and turn right on Starratt Road (there is a barn on your right with a bright red roof!). Continue along Starratt Road for 4.2 kms (if you go any further you will be in the lake) – at this point the road turns 90 degrees to the right and the name changes to Sandwood Drive. Continue for another 13 seconds (approximately 130 meters) and you will be at Baker’s Landing (#19 Sandwood Drive)!

Highway #11 is 4-lane driving all the way to Burks Falls, which now boasts a Tim Hortons coffee shop!
