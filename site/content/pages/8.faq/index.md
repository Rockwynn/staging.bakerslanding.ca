Magnetawan, only a short 20 minute boat ride away has a beautiful public park with a fabulous beach. They have a picnic area with BBQ stands, and a full childrens play area, close to the beach. (this works out well when one child is on the play set and the other on the beach.) Magnetawan has a drive-in/walk-up outdoor ice cream dairy bar with picnic tables – the cones are huge and they have great burgers as well. It is actually a cottage tradition to go to “Mag” and get ice cream. Fond memories! The Magnetawan Locks are a “must see” – you can park your boat right at the locks, or boat through them down into Ahmic Lake!</p>
