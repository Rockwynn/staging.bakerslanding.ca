Both the upper and lower deck and the dock are ideal for sun bathing, watching the world go by, a morning cup of coffee or an evening drink. The dock ladder allows easy access to the lake for swimming. A 14′ fibreglass row boat with oars comes with Jeff’s Vacation Home. Boats and/or motors can be rented on the lake and there are boat launches if you have your own boat. Come listen to the loons, relax and enjoy the good life at the lake!

A well behaved 100% house trained friendly dog that is good with strangers is allowed if the owners agree to “poop and scoop” and never leave the dog unattended. The dog must be on a leash and cannot be left alone in the house or tied outside to bark at any time. A maximum of 2 dogs are allowed.
